            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Dowlathnisa SB, a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student at Agni College of Technology.Currently maintaining a CGPA of 8.34 in my fourth semester,
                
                 With a passion for both front-end and back-end development, I'm on a journey to become a skilled full-stack web developer and UI/UX designer.
                 <br>
                 <br>


                 I'm deeply committed to academic excellence while actively engaging in practical projects to apply my knowledge.
                
                  One of my notable achievements includes developing a dynamic website for a bookshop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP for database integration. Utilizing XAMPP, I ensured efficient data storage and retrieval.
                
                In the realm of UI/UX design, I've crafted a complete international travel app using Figma, showcasing my creativity and attention to user experience. With over 10 model designs in Figma, I constantly explore new design trends and methodologies to deliver captivating user interfaces.
                <br><br>

                Driven by a thirst for challenges and innovation, I've participated in several hackathons, including the Accenture Innovation Challenge, Smart India Hackathon, Smart Agni Hackathon, and Data Science Contest using RapidMiner by BITS Pilani. These experiences have honed my technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, and Python, and I'm currently expanding my expertise in Java.
                <br><br>
                Beyond technical proficiency, 
                I value soft skills such as teamwork, adaptability, and time management. As an organizer of symposiums at Agni College of Technology, I've demonstrated leadership qualities and organizational prowess. Successfully orchestrating events like the Connection Event has enriched my interpersonal skills and ability to foster collaboration.
                <br><br>
                I'm genuinely excited about the endless possibilities in the field of technology and look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to the industry.
